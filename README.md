TinDog Starting Files
This is a small application of HTML5 , CSS3 and Javascript.It is a simple website with UI and color theme similar to tinder as the name itself suggests its a dating for dogs , sounds crazy ;) . The project is inspired from the course which i took to learn web development which was mentored by Angela Yu (The App Brewery).
