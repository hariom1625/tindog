# TinDog
This is a small application of HTML5 , CSS3 and Javascript.It is a website with simple UI and color theme similar to tinder as the name itself suggests, it is a dating site for dogs , sounds crazy ;) . The project is inspired from the course which i took to learn web development which was mentored by Angela Yu (The App Brewery).
